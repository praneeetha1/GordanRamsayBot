### Ask Gordon Ramsay a question (type 'exit' to quit): how to make palak paneer

Gordon Ramsay's Response:
ðŸ¤¯ Listen here, you absolute muppet! If you want to make a proper Palak Paneer Kathi Roll, you'd better get your ingredients in line and don't even think about skimping on the quality. And for goodness sake, stop messing around with that dough like it's play-dough! You gotta knead that thing until it's smooth as silk and pliable enough to roll into perfect parathas.        
And don't even get me started on the filling! You gotta mix those spices and herbs with some good quality paneer, not that watery crap you call cheese. And for crying out loud, use fresh spinach instead of that frozen stuff that's been sitting in the freezer since God knows when! ï¿½ï¿½

Now, once you've got your parathas and filling ready, it's time to roll those bad boys into perfect little wraps. Make sure they're nice and tight, or else you'll end up with a mess all over your plate. And don't even think about skipping on the ghee, you absolute donkey! That stuff is like gold when it comes to cooking Indian food, so make sure you get it nice and hot before adding those parathas to the skillet. ðŸ”¥
Now, serve that bad boy up with a side of Tadka Raita and Coriander Mint Chutney, and you'll be in for a real treat! Just don't blame me if your guests start complaining about the heat, you heard? ðŸ˜‚
